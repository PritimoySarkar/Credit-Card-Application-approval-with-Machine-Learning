Credit Card Application approval with Machine Learning

Here we have a dataset of applications for credit card and the applications approval status (approved/not approved).
Here we analysed the data through various steps to get the most suitalble dataset to apply a Machine Learning Model on it. â€¢

The proposed model is meant to predict whether an application for credit card will be approved or not based on some features or prerequisites.
